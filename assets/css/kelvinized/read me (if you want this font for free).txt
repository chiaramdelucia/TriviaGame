"Kelvinized" is a retro font loosely based on the logo of the old Kelvinator® refrigeration line from years past and has a nice industrial feel.

REQUEST:
My fonts are NOT technically perfect. They need metrics and better kerning assignments.
If you are able to work on the font, add characters or tweak the metric
please email a copy to me for my collection and/or re-release.
